# RAM Simulation with 5-Stage Pipeline Integration

## Overview

This project is a RAM (Random Access Memory) simulation that provides basic read and write functionalities. Additionally, it integrates the simulation into a 5-stage pipeline for better visualization. The interactive visualization is achieved using IMGUI (Immediate Mode Graphical User Interface) and SDL2.

## Features

- Basic RAM simulation with read and write operations.
- Integration into a 5-stage pipeline for advanced visualization.
- Interactive graphical user interface using IMGUI.
- Visualization powered by SDL2 for a user-friendly experience.
- also have the static site for visualization provided https://d-a-y-dev.github.io/mips-visualiser/

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the project:

- C++ Compiler
- IMGUI Library
- SDL2 Library
